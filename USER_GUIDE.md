## Earning Coins (Visitor Mode)

### Step 1: Browse Campaigns

1. Navigate to **"Earn"** page (`/earn`)
2. You'll see up to **10 available campaigns**
3. Each campaign card shows:
   - **Campaign Title** - What you'll be visiting
   - **Coins per Visit** - How much you can earn
   - **Watch Duration** - How long you need to stay (30-120 seconds)
   - **Value Tier Badge** - HIGH (10+ coins), MEDIUM (5-9 coins), LOW (<5 coins)
   - **Clicks Remaining** - How many visits are still available

### Step 2: Choose a Campaign

**Important Limits to Know:**

Campaigns are limited based on their value tier:

| Tier | Coins/Visit | Daily Limit | Weekly Limit | Monthly Limit | Cooldown |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **HIGH** | 10+ coins | 1 visit | 3 visits | 5 visits | 60 minutes |
| **MEDIUM** | 5-9 coins | 2 visits | 6 visits | 10 visits | 30 minutes |
| **LOW** | <5 coins | 3 visits | 10 visits | 15 visits | 15 minutes |

**What This Means:**
- You can't do the same high-value campaign multiple times in one day
- There's a cooldown period between attempts on the same campaign
- These limits prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution

**If a Campaign is Unavailable:**
- The card will show why (e.g., "Daily limit reached")
- It will show when you can try again (e.g., "Try again in 45 minutes")
- **Tip:** Refresh the page to see the latest availability

### Step 3: Start the Visit

1. Click **"Start Visit"** on a campaign
2. A **popup window** will open with the campaign website
3. The **Gateway page** will show:
   - Timer countdown (watch duration)
   - Progress bar
   - Instructions

**During Your Visit:**
- ✅ Keep the popup window **active and in focus**
- ✅ Browse the website naturally (we track engagement)
- ✅ Pay attention to the content (you'll be quizzed on it!)
- ❌ Don't just let the timer run out - actually look around
- ❌ Don't switch tabs or minimize (engagement tracking)

### Step 4: Complete the Quiz

After the watch duration, you'll see a **5-question quiz**:

**Question Types:**
1. **Multiple Choice** - Select one correct answer
2. **Dropdown** - Choose from a dropdown menu
3. **Free Text** - Type your answer (case-insensitive)

**Quiz Rules:**
- You must answer **all 5 questions**
- You need **at least 3 correct (60%)** to pass
- Questions are about the website you just visited
- Some questions are general (e.g., "Did you see a contact form?")

**How Rewards are Calculated:**

- **3/5 correct:** 33% of full reward (multiplier: 0.33)
- **4/5 correct:** 66% of full reward (multiplier: 0.66)
- **5/5 correct:** 100% of full reward (multiplier: 1.00)
- **0-2 correct:** No reward (failed quiz)

**Example:**
- Campaign offers: 10 coins
- You get 4/5 correct
- Your reward: 10 × 0.66 = **6.66 coins**

### Step 5: Claim Your Reward

1. Review your quiz results
2. See your calculated reward
3. Click **"Claim Reward"**
4. Coins are added to your wallet immediately
5. You'll see a success message with your new balance

- Learn from the experience - pay more attention next time!

### Consolation Rewards

**Consolation Limits:**
- Maximum **2 consolations per day**

## Promoting Your Content (Creator Mode)

### Why Create a Campaign?

- Get **real, engaged visitors** to your website
- Build **brand awareness**
- Increase **website traffic**
- Promote **products, services, or content**
- Visitors are verified through quizzes (quality traffic!)

### Step 1: Navigate to Promote Page

Go to **"Promote"** (`/promote`)

You'll see two tabs:
- **Create Campaign** - Make a new campaign
- **Your Campaigns** - Manage existing campaigns

### Step 2: Fill Out Campaign Details

#### Campaign Title
- **What:** A catchy, descriptive title for your campaign
- **Length:** 5-120 characters
- **Example:** "Check out our new eco-friendly water bottles!"

#### Target URL
- **What:** The website you want visitors to see
- **Must be HTTPS** (secure connection required)
- **Example:** `https://www.yourwebsite.com/product-page`

#### Coins Per Visit (Base Reward)
- **What:** How much you'll pay each visitor who completes the quiz
- **Range:** 0.001 to 1000 coins
- **Recommendation:**
  - Low-value campaigns (<5 coins): Good for general traffic
  - Medium-value (5-9 coins): Good engagement
  - High-value (10+ coins): Premium placement and engagement

**Important:** The actual coins per visit is slightly higher due to watch duration bonus. The longer the duration, the higher the bonus.

#### Watch Duration
- **What:** How long visitors must stay on your site
- **Options:** 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120 seconds
- **Cost:** Every extra 15 seconds beyond 30s costs **5 additional coins per visit**
- **Recommendation:**
  - 30-45s: Quick overview campaigns
  - 60-90s: Standard engagement
  - 90-120s: Deep engagement (product demos, detailed content)

#### Total Clicks (Budget)
- **What:** How many successful visits you want
- **Range:** 1 to 1000 clicks
- **Your Campaign:** Continues until this number is reached

### Step 3: Create Quiz Questions

You need to create **exactly 5 verification questions** to ensure visitors actually engaged with your content.

**Choose from Question Bank (20 Questions):**

The platform provides 20 pre-made questions like:
1. "Did you see a contact form?"
2. "What was the main color scheme?"
3. "Was there a product image?"
4. "Did you see pricing information?"
5. ...and 16 more

**For Each Question:**
1. **Select Question ID** (1-20)
2. **Choose Input Type:**
   - **Dropdown** - Visitor selects from dropdown
   - **MCQ** - Visitor clicks one option (multiple choice)
   - **Free Text** - Visitor types the answer

3. **Configure Options (for Dropdown/MCQ):**
   - Provide 3-5 options
   - Mark which one(s) are correct
   - Options will be randomized for visitors

4. **Configure Answers (for Free Text):**
   - Provide acceptable answers (case-insensitive)
   - Supports synonyms (e.g., "blue", "navy", "azure")

**Tips for Good Questions:**
- Ask about obvious, easy-to-verify things on your page
- Don't make questions too hard (you want people to pass!)
- Use a mix of question types
- Test your own campaign to verify questions make sense

### Step 4: Review Pricing & Create

**Cost Calculation:**

```
Base Cost = Coins Per Visit × Total Clicks
Duration Cost = (Watch Duration - 30) / 15 × 5 × Total Clicks
Total Cost = Base Cost + Duration Cost
```

**Example:**
- Coins per visit: 10
- Watch duration: 60 seconds
- Total clicks: 100

```
Base Cost = 10 × 100 = 1,000 coins
Duration Cost = (60 - 30) / 15 × 5 × 100 = 2 × 5 × 100 = 1,000 coins
Total Cost = 1,000 + 1,000 = 2,000 coins
```

**Before Creating:**
- Review your campaign details
- Ensure you have enough coins in your wallet
- Double-check your quiz questions

**After Creating:**
- Coins are **immediately deducted** from your wallet
- Your campaign goes **live immediately**
- You'll be redirected to "Your Campaigns" tab

### Step 5: Manage Your Campaigns

In the **"Your Campaigns"** tab, you can:

**View Campaign Details:**
- Title and URL
- Value tier badge (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Creation time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Total budget (coins spent)
- Progress: "X of Y visits served"
- Status: Active, Paused, or Finished

**Available Actions:**

1. **Pause Campaign**
   - Click "Pause"
   - Campaign becomes invisible to visitors
   - Your budget is preserved
   - Use this when: You need to update your website, fix something, or take a break

2. **Resume Campaign**
   - Click "Resume"
   - Campaign becomes active again
   - Visitors can find and complete it

3. **Delete Campaign**
   - Click "Delete"
   - **Refund Policy:**
     - Unused portion is refunded to your wallet
     - Refund = (Total Budget × Remaining Clicks / Total Clicks)
   - **Example:**
     - Total budget: 1000 coins
     - Total clicks: 100
     - Served: 30
     - Refund: 1000 × (70/100) = 700 coins
   - Campaign is permanently deleted

**Campaign Lifecycle:**

1. **Active** - Visible in earn queue, serving visitors
